"Java already supports running a java file directly, why is this needed?"

"Aren't we like 1-3 releases away from already having this functionallity in Java?"

Its almost certain that everytime a story or tweet about JBang pops up on social media questions like the above gets asked. 

Java's default toolchain has definitely improved over the years, but JBang stills provide value. I'm sure Java will continue to improve and add features and as they become available I'll keep updating this page.

JBang started out as a way to do scripting with Java - i.e. `jbang hello.java` would handle calling `javac` to create a jar file and then `java` to run it. It is this basic approach that makes many ask "Java 11 already supports doing `java hello.java` why should I care?"

The thing is that the compilation and run actually is just a small part of what a user need to do. Lets try and break down all the elements of being able to run java as a script.

. Download and install Java
. Create or Download the script/app
. Fetch dependencies
. Compile
. (Optionally) Cache the result for speed
. Run

These are not all required all the time. For example many have java already installed - but it does happen you need to get a different version of Java than the one already installed. Thus it is part of steps that exist with default Java but is handled automatically when using JBang. 

Lets show how JBang compares with modern Java for this:
