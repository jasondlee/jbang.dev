In March https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/408[JEP: 408: Simple Web Server] was announced. One of JEP 408's goals is to make an easy to use web server available with Java using `java -m jdk.httpserver`.

It is a nice idea and I'm looking forward to see it happen.

That said - you do not need to wait for Java 18+ to get this. You can use `jbang httpd@jbangdev` today with Java 1.8 and upwards.

It is a https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-catalog/blob/main/httpd.java[script] I wrote in a few hours after seeing https://twitter.com/sebi2706/status/1399966303625097217[yet another tweet] asking for a simple to use webserver. Like JEP 408 it only uses classes available in the JDK, meaning zero additonal download and setup besides https://jbang.dev/download[installing] `jbang`.

By default, `httpd@jbangdev` will serve the current directory on https://localhost:8000.

Below is an example of using `httpd@jbangdev` to serve this website locally from its statically generated Jekyll `_site` folder on port 8080.

[source,shell]

As with any other `jbang` capable application you can also choose to install it in your `PATH` using `jbang app install http@jbangdev`. Once you do that you can run it from anywhere using just `httpd`.

In case you already have application called `httpd` you can use `--name` to give it a more unique name:

[source,shell]
----
$ jbang app install --name jhttpd httpd@jbangdev
[jbang] Command installed: jhttpd
$ jhttpd

Enjoy - and remember you can find `httpd@jbangdev` and other apps in https://jbang.dev/appstore[JBang AppStore].
